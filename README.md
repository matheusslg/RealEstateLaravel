# RealEstateLaravel
 System developed with Laravel for college task.

Step 1. Create a database called 'realestate' (without quotes) and import the two SQL files inside '/database/sql' folder. These files contains the brazilian cities and states. If you want to use cities and states from another country, make a table with same properties and call the name of the city by 'nome' or change it on property migration. <br /><br />
Step 2. Open the commmand prompt inside the folder of the project an type the following commands in this order: <br /><br />
        <strong>php artisan key:generate</strong> <br />
        <strong>php artisan migrate</strong> <br />
        <strong>php artisan serve</strong> <br /><br />
Step 3. Now you can open your browser and access the website by the URL http://localhost:8000/ <br />

Enjoy it!
